Have you ever felt as if rails were too expensive? Do you wish that copper had more uses?
If so, Railed is the mod for you!

## What's different?
Railed changes the recipes for the various types of rails so that they are more affordable for long distance rail networks.
### Basic Rails:
Basic Rails felt too expensive as 6 iron ingots for 16 rails, that's only 2.67 rails/ingot!
This mod changes their recipe to require iron nuggets instead of ingots for an improved 24 rails/ingot!
It also adds more sticks to the recipe to better match the texture.
### Rail Variations:
Activator, Detector and Powered Rails now all follow the format of a variation-specific item, a rail, and a redstone dust for 1 of the rail variation.
### Powered Rails:
Powered Rails now look a tad bit different, now being made of copper, not gold. This change was made to:
1. Slightly decrease the cost of Powered Rails as copper is easier to obtain than gold
2. Add a new use for copper
3. Make space for funkier, fresher, gold rails in a future potential update
### Self-Powered Rails
An upgrade to the Powered Rails. Enhanced with a Gold Ingot and a Redstone Torch, these Rails will accelerate your minecarts without the need to be powered first. If you do power them however, they will slow the minecart down to a stop (just like un-powered regular Powered Rails.)

## Other Notes:
If I get around to it, I might eventually make other changes to rails & minecarts but none of these have been added:
- Modify the Minecart speed to make rails an actually viable transport method (unlikely since Mojang now has an experiment for that.)
- QOL rail related blocks like an intersection or something?

Who knows if I'll actually get around to doing any of these things though.
